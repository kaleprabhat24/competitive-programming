## Problem Statement

### TCS Examination

Two friends, Dragon and Sloth, are writing a computer science examination series.
There are three subjects in this series: DSA\text{DSA}DSA, TOC\text{TOC}TOC, and DM\text{DM}DM. Each subject carries 100100100 marks.

You know the individual scores of both Dragon and Sloth in all 333 subjects. You have to determine who got a better rank.

The rank is decided as follows:

- The person with a bigger total score gets a better rank

- If the total scores are tied, the person who scored higher in DSA\text{DSA}DSA gets a better rank

- If the total score and the DSA\text{DSA}DSA score are tied, the person who scored higher in TOC\text{TOC}TOC gets a better rank

- If everything is tied, they get the same rank.

### Input Format

- The first line of input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.

- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Dragon in DSA\text{DSA}DSA, TOC\text{TOC}TOC and DM\text{DM}DM respectively.

- The second line of each test case contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Sloth in DSA\text{DSA}DSA, TOC\text{TOC}TOC and DM\text{DM}DM respectively.

### Output Format

- For each test case, if Dragon got a better rank then output `"Dragon"`, else if Sloth got a better rank then output `"Sloth"`. If there was a tie then output `"Tie"`. Note that the string you output should not contain quotes.

- The output is **case insensitive**. For example, If the output is "Tie" then "TiE", "tiE", "tie", etc are also considered correct.

### Constraints

- 1≤T≤10001 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000

- Each score of both Dragon and Sloth lies between 000 and 100100100.

### Subtasks

**Subtask #1 (100 points):** Original constraints

```

DRAGON
```

### Explanation:

- For the first test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score but Sloth gets a better rank because he has a higher score in DSA\text{DSA}DSA.

- For the second test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same rank because they have the same score among all subjects.

- For the third test case, Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater total score.

- For the fourth test case, Sloth and Dragon have the same total score and same DSA\text{DSA}DSA score. Dragon gets a better rank because he has a greater TOC\text{TOC}TOC score.
