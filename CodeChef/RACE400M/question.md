Alice, Bob, and Charlie participated in a 400400400-metre race.

The time taken by Alice, Bob, and Charlie to complete the race was X,Y,X, Y,X,Y, and ZZZ seconds respectively. Note that X,Y,X, Y,X,Y, and ZZZ are **distinct**.

Determine the person having the highest average speed in the race.

### Input Format

- The first line of input will contain a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases.

- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X,Y,X, Y,X,Y, and ZZZ — the time taken by Alice, Bob, and Charlie to complete the race.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

- `ALICE`, if Alice had the highest average speed.

- `BOB`, if Bob had the highest average speed.

- `CHARLIE`, if Charlie had the highest average speed.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `BOB`, `bob`, `Bob`, and `BoB` are all considered identical.

### Constraints

- 1≤T≤10001 \leq T \leq 10001≤T≤1000

- 1≤X,Y,Z≤1001 \leq X, Y, Z \leq 1001≤X,Y,Z≤100

- X,Y,X, Y,X,Y, and ZZZ are distinct.

### Explanation:

**Test case 111:** The time taken by the three participants to complete a 400400400 metre race was 1,2,1, 2, 1,2, and 888 respectively. Thus, their respective speeds were 4001=400,4002=200,\frac{400}{1} = 400, \frac{400}{2} = 200,1400​=400,2400​=200, and 4008=50\frac{400}{8} = 508400​=50 metres per second respectively.

Thus, Alice has the maximum speed.

**Test case 222:** The time taken by the three participants to complete a 400400400 metre race was 4,100,4, 100, 4,100, and 111 respectively. Thus, their respective speeds were 4004=100,400100=4,\frac{400}{4} = 100, \frac{400}{100} = 4,4400​=100,100400​=4, and 4001=400\frac{400}{1} = 4001400​=400 metres per second respectively.

Thus, Charlie has the maximum speed.

**Test case 333:** Since Bob takes the minimum time to complete the race, he has the maximum average speed.
